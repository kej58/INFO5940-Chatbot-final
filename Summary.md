# RAG Prompt Engineering Experiment Summary

## Project Overview

This project explored how subtle variations in prompt phrasing affect the quality and depth of results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, specifically Perplexity.ai. By testing various structured prompts across three key domains—Food Safety, Mental Health, and Wearable Health Tech—we aimed to identify which prompt engineering methods best enhance information retrieval and response accuracy.

## Data Insights Summary（similar to key points in evaluation）

### Comparative Prompts Yield Highest Quality

* **Comparative questions** consistently outperformed other prompt types across metrics like authority, depth, and accuracy.
* For instance, prompts comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) in mental health received full marks across all evaluation dimensions, demonstrating exceptional depth and authoritative sourcing.
* Similarly, prompts comparing food safety guidelines across regions or between FDA standards and actual kitchen practices showed significantly enhanced completeness and authoritative sourcing.

### Technical Context Prompts Enhance Professional Depth

* Including explicit **technical or scientific contexts** (e.g., biomedical engineering, neurobiology) significantly boosted response accuracy and depth, especially in domains requiring technical understanding.
* These prompts retrieved richer, more scientifically robust content, often citing peer-reviewed articles and authoritative academic sources.
* Examples from the Wearable Health Tech domain particularly benefited from this approach, showcasing detailed sensor technology insights and clinical validation data.

### Personal Context Improves Relevance and Practicality

* Prompts incorporating **personal context or situational scenarios** (e.g., cooking for children and elderly or managing workplace stress) improved relevance and completeness of responses.
* The resulting answers were highly practical, offering detailed guidance directly applicable to user-specific contexts.
* This effect was particularly prominent in Food Safety and Mental Health scenarios, where personalized prompts led to comprehensive, actionable advice.

### Basic Prompts Effective for General Queries but Lack Depth

* General or simple question prompts effectively generated relevant and complete basic information but were weaker in authority and depth.
* These prompts often relied heavily on blogs and general informational websites, lacking robust scholarly or governmental backing.
* Useful for quick reference but limited for complex informational needs or expert-level insights.

## Innovations

### Structured Prompt Categorization

* Developed a systematic framework categorizing prompts into basic, contextual (personal and technical), and comparative types.
* This clear, modular approach enabled precise analysis of individual prompt elements' impact on model performance, providing reusable strategies for future prompt design.

### Fine-grained Control of RAG Inputs

* Introduced methods to embed specific background information or situational constraints directly into prompts, effectively guiding the model's retrieval behavior and resulting in targeted, higher-quality responses.

### Standardized Source Verification Metrics

* Established clear metrics for evaluating source authority and recency, guiding the model towards more credible and timely information.
* Emphasized the importance of authoritative sourcing, significantly enhancing overall response trustworthiness.

### Comprehensive Evaluation and Visualization

* Created a multi-dimensional evaluation rubric covering completeness, relevance, authority, accuracy, recency, and depth.
* Utilized visual tools like heatmaps and bar charts for clear, intuitive representation of performance differences across prompt variations.

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Limited Sample Size and Domain Scope

* Currently limited to three thematic areas and a modest number of prompt variations per theme.
* Future research should expand the thematic coverage (e.g., finance, education) and increase sample sizes to enhance generalizability and robustness.

### Model Output Variability

* Inherent variability in RAG outputs, with some inconsistency in results between different runs.
* Future work should incorporate additional control mechanisms, possibly via model fine-tuning or tighter constraints on retrieval processes to enhance consistency.

### Insufficient Stability Assessment

* Single-run evaluations do not adequately assess stability across multiple attempts.
* Recommend repeated trials of each prompt and employing statistical analyses or embedding-based consistency metrics to robustly quantify result stability.

## Future Outlook: Automated Prompt Recommendation System

Envisioning an automated prompt recommendation framework that applies identified best practices dynamically. This system would:

* **Analyze user queries** to detect intent and informational needs.
* Leverage an **internal database of proven prompt structures** (contextual, comparative, technical).
* **Automatically refine and generate optimized prompts** based on real-time analysis.
* Feed optimized prompts into existing RAG models to consistently produce high-quality, contextually relevant outputs.

This automated workflow can also incorporate feedback loops to continuously learn from outcomes and further refine prompt recommendations, as depicted below:

```
User Query → [Prompt Recommendation Module] → Optimized Prompt → [RAG Model] → Enhanced Answer

               Prompt Database
```
